# I'm an EM and this is how I think AI might impact the engineering in my teams 

> *Klarna, the buy-now-pay-later unicorn, fired 700 employees last year [2024] claiming AI could do their tasks. However, within a year they were on a hiring spree and their CEO stated, “[what you end up having is lower quality](https://fortune.com/2025/05/09/klarna-ai-humans-return-on-investment/)…investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.”

I don’t want to come across as a fear-mongerer. The reason I’m interested in this topic is because I see signals that hint at a growing bubble of incompetence. Which means we will only see the effects months or years later. As EMs, each of you will have to deal with outcomes of LDD or LLM Driven Development.

I’ve seen vibe coding cleanup jobs on linkedin

I’ve seen juniors write heavily AI inspired code that they then don’t understand and can’t fix.

I’ve seen engineers who barely can put together a coherent sentence, write documents with the eloquence of Shakespear *(and here the point is the contrast, not the ability of the engineer)*

Code reviews can be done by AI now. So an engineer doesn’t even need to try too hard to read the code. AI thinks its ok? Then let me just skim over in 10 seconds.

Something feels off. And I know there are others that feel the same way.

We’re at an interesting point where there isn’t a critical mass of engineers with many years/decades of experience that have also been using AI for the majority of their career.

So when talking with senior engineers that adopted LLMs in their daily life, you hear how great LLMs has been at increasing their productivity. How this tool helps them to complete mundane, boring tasks with ease. 

What is fascinating to me is that there’s been many reports *(maybe even in Printify)* that found virtually no impact on productivity. Some even noticed decrease in speed.

And yet, AI Adoption sometimes seems like the holy grail of productivity.

However, now we are spilling over into a new era of programmers starting with LLMs. You don’t need to read Design Patterns. You don’t need to read Clean Code or working effectively with legacy code. You don’t need to know refactoring patterns and code smells. LLM will do it for you. If I would sit at a nuclear physics lecture and parrot everything that the professor says, I’d learn basically nothing, nor understand anything. The difference is nobody will ask me to then go create a nuclear reactor. But when it comes to a software engineer - that person will be asked to build something.

I’ll repeat that I’m not Anti-AI. It’s a tool that has been really helpful in many instances. And for those of us with enough experience, we are able to counterbalance AI. As managers, we will be the ones to deal with effects of LDD. 

Question is do you want to deal with it adhoc or prepare proactively? The choice will impact who you hire, what processes you adopt in the team, how engineers in your teams drive technical excellency and what technical debt they are creating like heavy coupling of domains or significant but subtle security gaps

An idea that I keep coming back to is this:

> *If its hard in the short term, its easy in the long term. If its easy in the short term, its hard in the long term.*
> 

Which to me means we need to struggle. We need to put obstacles in front of us, maybe on purpose and consciously choose to NOT use assisting tools like LLMs.

> *AI is overfishing in our professional waters, draining the early-career experiences that once developed judgment and skill. When organizations eliminate “inefficient” learning processes, they’re dismantling the systems that create wisdom. Junior professionals miss opportunities to observe how experts navigate ambiguity. They skip the productive failures that build judgment.
