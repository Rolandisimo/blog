# When you feel stupid or incompetent
<small><em>Published on <date>08.04.2023</date></em></small>

- "This was a stupid mistake"
- "I should've known that"
- "Why am I being so dumb?"

Have you said something like that to yourself or others? I have.
I've beaten myself up for not achieving, not having the foresight, not being able to do what others are doing, and every time I come out of it feeling like a part of me has been just ripped out.

Moments later I pretend like nothing has happened. Maybe even retort back that it doesn't bother me all that much. If any of this sounds familiar then you know you're not alone. Behind these paper cut comments lies a web of hurt, insecurities, trauma, fears that might be too hard to face. It's a pandoras box not everyone is willing to open. Sometimes for their whole lives.

I have gone suppressing consciously and repressing unconsciously my emotions for decades now. I'm 28 at the time of writing and I can only wonder what life would be like if I had unlatched the door earlier.

The sentences you read at the beginning of the article are a manifestation of our fears. When I say "I am stupid", what I'm really saying might be "I have not met the level I expected". If we dig deeper, we can approach this in 2 ways - problem solving or compassion.

If I problem solve that sentence, then I am suppressing my emotions, burying whatever trauma caused me to say such a derogative phrase in the first place. It might help me in the moment and I might move on, but nothing has really changed.

The feelings behind that phrase are still bottled inside of me, anxiously waiting to get out like bubbles in a shaken soda bottle, and they will get out.

The problem with that is that you don't get to pick when and how those feelings blow the lid off. It might result in you snapping at your loved one and them thinking that talking to you is like "walking on eggshells". I've heard that from my wife.

What kind of dynamic do you think that creates in the relationship?

Now, the other approach is compassione.

If I'm ready and brave enough to be kind and vulnerable then to the phrase "I am stupid" the response can be - What makes you stupid? Here's an example conversation:

— I am stupid
<br/>
— What makes you stupid?
<br/>
— I made a stupid mistake at work
<br/>
— Why did you make that mistake?
<br/>
— Because I didn't pay attention that there was an instruction posted on how to do X
<br/>
— Why didn't you pay attention?
<br/>
— Because I have 5 projects going on at the same time
<br/>
— Personal life hasn't been easy either, right?
<br/>
— Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well lately because of the responsibility I feel from those projects. I don't want to dissapoint my boss and that makes me stressed
<br/>
— That most likely is actually distracting you which in turn can lead to such mistakes like you made
<br/>
— True. Also, I have been a bit behind on my bills
<br/>
— Yeah, finances can beat one down. Hey, I am sorry it's been tough. It will get better for you. I'm here for you if you need me.

This could be a conversation with a (good) friend or, in fact, yourself. If you learn to love yourself then this compassionate conversationalist will always be there for you when you need him.

What's my point?

You're not stupid. You're hurt. However, being vulnerable and opening up is a frightening and herculean task. Sometimes it's easier to use potentially damaging logic for such situations and disregard the feelings.

Ah what's the big deal anyways, right? Right? Trust me. It becomes a big deal when you want it the least.
