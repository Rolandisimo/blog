# An engineering culture needs an engineering approach
<small><em>Published on 02.12.2022</em></small>

The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning "cleverness" and ingeniare, meaning "to contrive, devise".

When I joined [Printify](https://jobs.printify.com/) in 2020, I was a single engineer in a team that didn't have any software developers. After working for about half a year, I joined another team with other frontend (FE) developers. Before that I was either alone or together with only BE engineers.

Now I finally felt like a true spirit of a FE community will emerge in front of me. In reality, most of the FE engineers were a bit disconnected. Working in silos with minimal communication.

Some colleagues and I started talking about the need to share knowledge and standards amongst the FE developers. We decided to start a weekly FE community meeting. It's called "FE grooming".

Although, we created the meetings, I knew that you can't just make people suddenly change their habits, open up and change the way they were working. Therefore, I decided to proactively lead every meeting for a few months. I proposed most of the topics, shared tips and articles, addressed people in the meeting and asked for their opinion on whatever topic we were discussing.

Following that, I started a frontend styleguide which would become the de-facto standard for the whole FE community up to this day. Afterwards, more and more people started to suggest discussion topics for the meetings. Other engineers shared articles and tips. We started talking amongst ourselves. The silos started breaking down.

I am extremely grateful to everyone who took part in this and moved the FE guild forward. Without the right mindset, this would have never happened and I'm happy people were receptive enough to allow me to contribute to this culture.

To recap, here's what I think helped break the ice and encourage others to feel like a community in Printify:

- **Lead by example**. <br/>
<small>Show others that you care. Go the extra mile and do the work yourself.</small>

- **Keep notes**. <br/>
<small>Every meeting should be documented. I created a template for the meetings in confluence and used it for every meeting. It's a simple table with the following columns - topit title, topic details, discussions and a decision about the topic. Be sure to share them at the end of the meeting with everyone in the community</small>

- **Involve almost every engineer during the discussions.**<br/>
<small>Once there's more than 2-3 people in the meeting, most people will just freeze when asked "So, guys, what do you think?". Replace that with "John, what do you think about this?"</small>

- **Inspire people**<br/>
<small>Regardless of the amount of involvement or number of topics, keep talking about how we can be a community and create something trully worthwhile</small>

- **Keep showing up**<br/>
<small>You have to facilitate the community events regardless if its 1 person that joins or 21. People will notice and respect that. Most importantly this way you gain trust. You show that you care.</small>

- **Do the hard tasks yourself**<br/>
<small>Some improvements in our codebases required big efforts. At first I did them myself if nobody willingly volunteered. You can't ask people whos trust you haven't gained yet, to do extra work for a community they yet don't believe in.</small>

- **Show the people they matter** <br/>
<small>Do not ignore peoples ideas. Encourage them to share those and elaborate when you haven't understood something. Everyone should feel like their voice has weight. They must feel like they matter.</small>

The results are astonishing and truly inspiring when you see over 20 people coming together as one community.

Hopefully, this will inspire you to do something for your community.

Thank you.
