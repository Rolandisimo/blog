# How much to share with your boss?

I purposefuly left the question vague. I'll let you decide how you want to answer this question. Whether it is about sharing personal information or your emotional wellbeing or what you think about the direction the company is taking.

If you have a higher up that never asks you anything other than what were you working on today, I'm sorry for you. If you don't care about that, then my guess is there is some cynicism in you. Which is understandable. However, if you are in such a situation and it does bother you, I hope some of the ideas I share here will help.

In cases of abusive, toxic higher ups, it just might be that the best course of action is to quit. I ackowledge that not everyone is lucky enough to be able to make that decision lightly. Nevertheless, if you are able to quit and that won't impact your life dramatically - do it.

There are so many opportunities out there, one merely has to apply some creativity and be proactive while searching. Remember, there is no shame in finding a position that pays less but increases happiness. All the money in the world won't fill the void that one gets by working in a position that is suffocating.

I know it might be easier said than done, so I will add some light reading at the end that could inspire you.

Now, what about cases when you have an ok or even a great rapport with your higher ups? Without diving into the specifics of every scenario, I would suggest sharing your feelings that relate to the job as much as possible IF
- the goal is to improve your situation in a company e.g. you are in a team that you don't like and would love to switch
- you feel like the company is missing out on something e.g. not taking advantage of a trend or a particular customer segment.
- you do not believe in the direction the company/team is taking
- you want to give feedback to the manager

What I'm trying to convey is [radical candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) should be exercised in every team and company. Of course, it has to be introduced gradually and that's the job of a manager to want this done and facilitate an environment where it's safe to be candid.

In conclusion, my dear reader, how much should you share with your boss? As much as you feel is your duty. I've understood that not speaking out benefits nobody and eventually blows up in your face.

I admit it's not light but what it might help with is show that there are always ways to handle even the most unthinkable, unbearable circumstances if only one finds humor, love, higher purpose. And please don't think I'm saying that they suffered more, so you shouldn't even dare feeling what you're feeling. Your feelings are unequivocally valid. As Viktor Frankl said in the book:
> [...] a man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative.
