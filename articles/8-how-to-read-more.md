# How to read more?
<small><em>Published on 07.12.2022</em></small>

I assume you want to read more.

How much more, however, you most likely haven't really defined. Most of the time when I hear people (including myself) say this phrase, it brings with it a certain sense of guilt or shame. Almost as if something makes one feel that they are supposed to read more than they are reading now.

Why?

Humans are complex. Everyone has their own values and beliefs, and the nuanced influences of their environment. Yet, many of us seem to feel like we want to be someone else, someone smarter, someone better.

With books it feels it's around how educated or just plain smart you are. We might feel inadequate after meeting someone who was able to describe in length how soldiers in nazi Germany refused to accept blood that wasn't of type A because A type blood was considered Arian<sup>[1](https://abcnews.go.com/International/blood-purity-bizarre-obsession-advanced-science/story?id=19296143)</sup>.

Of course, not all books are equal and reading more does not necessarily mean being smarter.

Why should you feel lesser, though? You know something that others don't. That's the beauty of the human race. That each of us can bring a piece of the puzzle to the table to solve it together as a group. That's how we evolve and survive together.

Now, I realize I went on a tangent. I hope you can forgive me. I promised to answer how do you read more. Here's how I would do it.

- You have to understand why you want to read.<br/>
<small> Actually understand it. An effective approach for you might be to define an identity<sup>[2](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits)</sup> that would match this book reading behavior e.g. I am someone that educates himself on a constant basis.</small>

- Read 1 page per day<br/>
<small>Reading 1 page fits the criteria of more if previously you read 0 pages per day. In fact, that's how I get through books that sometimes I just can't get myself to read for whatever reason.</small>

- Make it a habit that you see<br/>
<small>Create a habit reminder using a calendar or a dedicated app. It has to be visible. A book next to your bed. On your working desk. Whatever allows you to be reminded about the book</small>

- Get an accountability partner<br/>
<small>I have an addiction to snacks. The way I deal with this when it goes too far is by telling my friend that I will give him a 100EUR if I buy a single snack within X number of days. Works like a charm. The point here is that get someone else to help you stick to the habit of reading</small>

- Find fun books<br/>
<small>Let's be real - some books suck. Even if the content might be good, the writing style can be excruciatingly boring. If it feels like a chore, perhaps a different book on the topic might be a better choice</small>

- Essays and Articles<br/>
<small>I recently discovered the beauty of essays that are much shorter than books but sometimes no less impactful. For example, essays by George Orwell<sup>[3](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/)</sup> have been my latest interest.</small>

- Goodreads.com<sup>[4](https://www.goodreads.com/)</sup><br/>
<small>A wonderful resource to track all your books and be inspired by what others are reading. [Here's mine](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66778938-rolands-jegorovs) </small>
