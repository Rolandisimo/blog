Sometimes I put myself in an environment which I know is not good for me. Today that was a Twitch stream related to Escape From Tarkov (a video game I enjoyed). In the stream I could watch a Tarkov tournament together with the streamer. The tournament had commentators talking about the rounds and teams competing. One of the commentators was a woman about whom the stream chat started making jokes like she is on her period, she forgot to change her pad and other insensitive comments about a woman they know nothing about. This happened shortly after a commercial break.

Feeling uncomfortable seeing a verbal violence being perpetuated against women, I shared my feelings about this in the chat. My message got read fully and with lots of intent by the streamer who proceeded to mock my comment and explain to me how "boys will be boys". Immediately after I was banned from posting in the chat, followed by a stream of insults, requests to leave the chat and doubling down on making sexist jokes.

After sticking around for a good 5 minutes I unfollowed the streamer, closed Twitch and asked Youtube to not suggest me his channel. All this with a thought that it doesn't bother me. The reaction I tried to project was one of not being bothered and confirmation of what I anyways expected.

But...

This didn't sit well with me. Something kept nagging at me.
I didn't let it go. I couldn't let it go.

I started playing the guitar for 15 minutes non-stop. Then I word-vomitted to my wife about how conflicted I am about not perpetuating violence and trying to empatize with the people in that Twitch chat (they must be miserable to feel such anger towards strangers) while simultaneously wanting to tell all of them that they're immature, ignorant assholes.

But...

It still wasn't it. I still felt a nagging feeling that wouldn't leave me until I finally understood what was it that bothered me so fervently.

**Rejection**

I hated being rejected and bullied. Especially by a group with whom I thought I had something in common - an appreciation of a particular video game.

After processing these feelings I once again dared to think about an ambitious goal that I'd like to see come to fruition one day:

To be a part of a group of people who perpetuate love, empathy and nonviolence in every aspect of life while being able to give and receive feedback with a growth mindset. People who keep their egos in check and take responsibility for all actions and inactions, for every word and sound they make before shifting their judgments onto others. And all of this done with a genuine desire to connect to themselves and to others. To not suppress feelings and emotions. To be honest with themselves and with others.
