Sometimes, I find myself in an environment that I know is not good for me. Today, it was a Twitch stream related to Escape From Tarkov, a video game I enjoy. In the stream, I watched a Tarkov tournament with a Twitch streamer. The tournament had commentators discussing the rounds and competing teams. One commentator, a woman, became the target of jokes in the stream chat about her period, forgetting to change her pad, and other insensitive comments about a woman they know nothing about. This happened shortly after a commercial break.

Feeling uncomfortable witnessing verbal violence against women, I shared my feelings about this in the chat. My message was fully read by the streamer and put on display for everyone, who proceeded to mock my comment and explain how "boys will be boys." Immediately after, I was banned from posting in the chat, followed by a stream of insults, requests to leave the chat, and doubling down on making sexist jokes.

After sticking around for a good 5 minutes, I unfollowed the streamer, closed Twitch, and asked Youtube not to suggest his channel to me. All this while trying to project an image of not being bothered and confirming what I expected anyway - a group of gamers on the internet will most likely be jerks.

But...

This didn't sit well with me. Something kept nagging at me. I didn't let it go. I couldn't let it go.

I played the guitar for 15 minutes non-stop. Then, I word-vomited to my wife about how conflicted I am about not perpetuating violence and trying to empathize with the people in that Twitch chat (they must be miserable to feel such anger towards strangers) while simultaneously wanting to tell all of them that they're immature, ignorant assholes.

But...

It still wasn't it. I still felt a nagging feeling that wouldn't leave me until I finally understood what bothered me so fervently.

Rejection.

I hated being rejected and bullied, especially by a group with whom I thought I had something in common - an appreciation of a particular video game.

After processing these feelings, I once again dared to think about an ambitious goal that I'd like to see come to fruition one day:

To be part of a group of people who perpetuate love, empathy, and nonviolence in every aspect of life while being able to give and receive feedback with a growth mindset. People who keep their egos in check and take responsibility for all actions and inactions, for every word and sound they make before shifting their judgments onto others. And all of this done with a genuine desire to connect with themselves and others. To not suppress feelings and emotions. To be honest with themselves and with others.
