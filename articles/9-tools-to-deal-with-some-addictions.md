# Tools to deal with addictions
<small><em>Published on 20.12.2022</em></small>

I have many addictions.

What I want to discuss here is:
- How do I perceive addictions?
- My addictions
- How dopamine relates to addiction
- What's common for all addicts?
- Tools that helped me deal with my addictions

An addiction from my perspective is a craving that stems from the unconscious. If you've read Thinking Fast and Slow<sup>[1](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)</sup>, I see it as the operation of System 1 or the fast thinking part of the brain.

This means that an addiction is not only related to drugs. It can be anything that you crave more than might be healthy. Something that you might be ashamed of. Something that makes you feel like you can't stop even though you want to.

For example, my addictions are the following:
- Snacks
- Video games
- Food

I didn't give them the proper attention for a long time until I started noticing that my snack and food intake has become much more than necessary for my body.

I would go from buying 1 bag of chips to 2 bags per sitting. From eating 1 chocolate bar to 5 bars per sitting. The consumed amount was growing ever so slightly at a pace one could notice only after months of sustained eating. That meant sinking deeper and deeper into my addiction as it does get increasingly harder to stop. The reason is because of how dopamine works.

Many think that dopamine regulates "happiness" but in reality it is responsible for motivation and craving. In short, every time you do or eat something pleasant, you get a spike of dopamine which is followed by a drop of dopamine below the previous baseline you had. Therefore your brain is craving to get back to that baseline. I highly suggest listening to an episode about dopamine<sup>[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmOF0crdyRU)</sup> from Dr. Andrew Huberman if you want to learn more about dopamine and tools to regulate it.

I believe that one thing that all addicts eventually get to is a feeling of shame. They know what they're doing is damaging to their health or relationships but they know they won't/can't stop.

What follows are logical albeit unconscious thought exercises to find loopholes for justifying the addiction. It doesn't have to make sense and frankly the real reasons behind addictions are never simple. Therefore, I urge you not to judge others and yourself until you fully understand the motivation.

An example of a loophole for me was something like this:

- Ok, I will eat 5 chocolate bars and I don't want my family or friends to find out. Therefore, I must hide this action from them. Let's eat all the chocolate bars in the car

This reminded me of how a relative of mine would go to the store and return smelling of alcohol but without any alcohol in the grocery bags, and then would proceed trying to argue that he didn't drink any alcohol. It was clearly ridiculous and almost childish. Similar to how a child eats a cake that was forbidden for him to eat, has his full face covered with chocolate and then proceeds to try to convince his parents that he didn't eat any cake.

Everybody knows Timmy ate the cake. Nom nom.

While for little Timmy this might just end with everyone laughing about it at family dinners, for an adult this might lead to a serious argument with a spouse. Somewhere in the middle of the screaming and gesticulations the problem can shift from the actual addiction to the "addict" _(I don't use this word negatively but rather to point out from which standpoint the perspective comes)_ accussing the spouse of not trusting him and that he can't be in a relationship where there is no trust.

Curiously, you can quickly notice that in this particular scenario the lack of trust actually comes from the "addict". However, admitting this for the addict would mean admitting that there is a problem. For him, that's not a solution because that is the persona the "addict" is trying to push away.

Essentially, he is trying to live 2 lives.

This never works and always leads to something blowing up.

For me that incident in a car was the tipping point. I had to do something about it and thankfully I was equipped to deal with the shame part. I was able to forgive myself and try to acknowledge that there is a deeper reason behind my addiction and my snack binge eating is just a manifestation of those deeper issues.

A really great resource that helped me realize this was a conversation between Tim Ferriss and Gabor Mat√©<sup>[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9B5mYfBPlY)</sup>. I suggest listening to the whole thing. One quote that stuck with me was

> Not why the addiction but why the pain?

## Tools that helped me
Now, I keep talking about all of this but how did I deal with some addictions?

Here's a list of things that helped me:
- "Atomic Habits" by James Clear<br/>
<small>This is a treasure trove of tools and heuristics of how to build good habits and stop bad habits. It's very practical and quick to read.</small>

- Accountability Partner<br/>
<small>Someone that can keep you accountable to upkeep your commitments to fight the addiction e.g. ask them to check your progress periodically. It's best that this is someone you respect and even look up to.</small>

- A bet of losing money<br/>
<small>For me this is an extremely effective and quick extension of the accountability partner method. What I do is text my friend and tell him e.g. that I will not buy any snacks for the next 30 days or else I will pay him 100EUR. I also noticed that the amount has to be substantial. I wouldn't care about 5EUR.</small>

- Therapy<br/>
<small>This requires a lot of effort but trust me it is worth every minute and cent you will spend on this activity. It can liberate you in ways you can't imagine.</small>

- Journaling<br/>
<small>Ideally a complementary activity to therapy but it can also be done as a standalone method. I suggest journaling daily. Remember that you don't have to write essays. A few sentences is better than nothing. At first it might feel awkward but trust me it gets better if you stick with it. Write to think!<sup>[4](https://medium.com/s/workflow/kevin-kelly-writes-to-find-out-what-he-doesnt-know-658ae1df1ae2)</sup></small>

- Podcasts<br/>
<small>Podcasts have exposed wonderful and even life-changing ideas to me. I mainly listen to Tim Ferriss<sup>[5](https://tim.blog/)</sup>, Dr. Andrew Huberman and sometimes Jock Willink. I almost always listen to them in my car while driving somewhere.</small>

Thank you for reading this and I hope this helps you or a relative/friend of yours. üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It's ok to not be ok. ‚ù§Ô∏è
