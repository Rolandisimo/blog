# What is the purpose of being an engineering manager?
<small><em>Published on 29.11.2022</em></small>

As an engineer I feel like this topic should be given proper care as whatever I write down here will in some way reflect on the engineers I manage at work.

Being assigned the title of an engineering manager (EM) I feel like my duty is to understand the meaning behind this title. It has 2 parts - 1) engineer and 2) manager. It's not enough for me to just be good in soft skills. I have to just as much be good in the various hard skills an engineer has. However, a fair question arises - to what degree can I let my hard skills degrade? If I only learn to be a good manager, I will gradually fall down to a mediocre if not rudimentary understanding of e.g. Javascript. I will certainly know the basics at a good level I believe even in 10 years because programming has become a daily habit but I will have become a relic when it comes to more advanced implementation details.

Should an EM care about losing the knowledge of lower level details? At first it might feel like you become inadequate and must keep up with the level of hard skills the engineers in your team have. Personally, eventually I feel like I accepted that giving the reins to the expert engineers in my and other teams to deal with the HOW of a code change is more important and beneficial to the team and company. Some of my responsibilities are:
- Allow engineers to work without blockers
- Improve working conditions
- Minimize redundancies e.g. bureaucracy, manual work
- Consult on the WHAT and high level HOW. The architectural level.
- Define the domain
- Allocate resources
- Prioritize technical changes/improvements done as compared to other company priorities
- Facilitate engineer collaboration
- Conduct regular 1:1s with my engineers
- Create a safe space and a rapport with the engineers. If they don't trust me, it's not an effective environment for anyone.
- Interview potential candidates
- Help other EMs when they reach out

If I would need to describe my purpose in one short sentence, it would be
