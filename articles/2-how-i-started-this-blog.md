# How I started this blog?
<small><em>Published on 29.11.2022</em></small>

I have written a few articles on medium.com which I republished on hackernoon.com and maybe some other place that I don't remember. Ever since those days, I felt like writing is liberating. It allows me to narrow my vision on a tiny sliver of my conscience.

On 28.11.2022 I decided to start writing again. Since this is a freestyle project I can do whatever I want. Therefore I decided to try out a new framework. I settled on Qwik which as of the time of writing is the new hype train.

There I was installing the dependencies, starting the project, learning the basics of Qwik, installing missing types, hating myself for having to style an article post from scratch, and debating with myself whether I should've just written on Medium or some other platform. trying to understand how to import .md files, then how do I render them, then... wait... why did I start doing this again?

After a day of making dozens of decisions, I understood that I forgot the main reason for even starting this journey - to write. Therefore, if I want to write, let's write. I just opened a new repo on Github, wrote an article in markdown and pushed the changes.

I started a blog. It's good enough.
